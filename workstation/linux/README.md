# Setup for DevOps on an GNU/Linux Workstation

## Scope

The scope of this setup is to get an Apple OSX based workstation to a usable state for tooling. The beginning state of OSX is already good enough for most tooling, but there are a few things we can tweak and add to get us up to a better level for most use-cases. 

## Applications

1. Terminal
2. VS Code
3. Terraform
4. Ansible
5. Git
